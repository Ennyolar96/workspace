                        <li>The businesses that aren't a good fit for Marketleag Workspace would be retail, and other related businesses. The type of businesses that are appointment base or have frequent traffic in and out of the space. There are spaces that allow these types of businesses and if you are looking for that we can point you in the right direction.</li>

Remember there is no long-term commitment needed, try it for a month and if it's not for you, you do not have to stay.</li>
